// TODO add tests for this component using vite/jest
// This would contain all tests related to the HcpTable
// The tests would use mock props and pass them to a simulated rendering of the component
// The tests would assert that the component behaves as expected
// e.g. if the component is passed a certain prop, it renders a certain way
// e.g. if a button is clicked on the component, it calls a certain function
